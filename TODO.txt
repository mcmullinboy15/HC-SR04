Test the wifi  adding on the pi

Test [git pull]ing while running
 * I might just not need to edit the run file while
   run-pulling but only manually pulling. Maybe I
   could have an update file that runs when I do
   the git pull and it does a git pull and other
   git pull stuff so I could edit the run.sh file.

 * I have determined I need to use crontab or maybe
   I need to have run.sh run once a day and then
   have exe_ver_1.0.py run for one day and stop.

Make sure that the name is linked with the email:
 * Mr. McMullin, Mrs. McMullin
 * mcmullinboy15@gmail.com, mcmullinand@gmail.com

Work on Exception Handling
 * except KeyboardInterrupt as ki
        error =  ki
        message = ki.ERROR ??? # 'KeyboardInterrupt'

Make a process for Jacob and try to make the process
simple and as easy  as possible. I want it to be
 * cd Documants
 * git clone ...

 That means that i'll need to change the .sh files where I do a cd /Documents/EZ_Salt/HC-SR04
