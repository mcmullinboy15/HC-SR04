Test the wifi  adding on the pi

Test [git pull]ing while running
 * I might just not need to edit the run file while
   run-pulling but only manually pulling. Maybe I
   could have an update file that runs when I do
   the git pull and it does a git pull and other
   git pull stuff so I could edit the run.sh file.
